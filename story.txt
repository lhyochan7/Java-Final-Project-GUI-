When I woke up, I found myself in a strange room.
I looked around the room and then heard a creepy sound.
"Welcome to my room."
"You're trapped here and the only way be free is to escape"
"If you succeed to escape this room, you're free."
"But you must be quick, after 15 minutes, you can't escape forever."
"You'd better hurry."
"You can get clues to escape by searching the room."
"Good Luck"
